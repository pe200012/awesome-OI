## Learning Resources
### Books
#### General
- [Competitive Programming, 2nd Edition](https://cpbook.net) Covers a collection of skills involved in ICPCs and IOIs.
- [Advanced Guide of Algorithm Contest](https://book.douban.com/subject/30136932/)
- [The Art of Algorithms and Olympics in Informatics](https://book.douban.com/subject/1154204/) A classic book for learning competitive programming. Outdated somehow.

#### Algorithm
- [Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms) The "bible" for algorithms and data structures. The writing is rigorous and sometime hard to understand.
- [Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X)
- [Algorithms by Jeff Erickson](https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/)
